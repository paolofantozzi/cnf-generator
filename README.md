# CNF Generator

## A (random) generator of Conjunctive Normal Form boolean formulas, isomorphic formulas and non-isomorphic formulas

This Python project allows users to generate and compare boolean formulas in Conjunctive Normal Form, respecting important features such as dimension, monotonicity, and, more important, isomorphism and non-ismorphism (trivial and non-trivial) of pairs.
It will be possibly useful in the future, in order to train specific Artificial Intelligences.
