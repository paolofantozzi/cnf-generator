# CNF Generator

## A (random) generator of Conjunctive Normal Form boolean formulas, isomorphic formulas and non-isomorphic formulas

This Python project allows users to generate and compare boolean formulas in Conjunctive Normal Form. These formulas respect important features such as: size, clause dimension, monotonicity, and, more important, isomorphism and non-ismorphism (trivial and non-trivial) between pairs.

It will be possibly useful in the future, in order to train specific Artificial Intelligences.

### Project Content
The project contains some useful functions. It follows an essential overview of the project's files content, where to find the needed functions and how to properly call them.

#### demo.py
It shows a possible use of the functions available in the project.

#### cnf_generator/cnf.py
This file contains the classes definitions of the needed entities:
1. Literals
2. Clauses
3. CNFs

Most of the times they'll not be necessary to the user: functions already create the needed objects.
